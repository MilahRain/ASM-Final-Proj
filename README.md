# ASM Final Project

## Description
This project was developed as part of coursework in x86 Assembly language. It demonstrates low-level programming concepts, including register manipulation, memory operations, loops, branching, and input/output routines.

## Technologies Used
- x86 Assembly
- MASM 
- Command-line tools

## What I Learned
- Working directly with CPU registers and memory
- Understanding program flow at the machine level
- Implementing logic without high-level constructs
- Strengthening debugging skills in low-level environments

## How to Run
1. Assemble the file using an assembly compiler such as MASM.
2. Link the resulting object file.
3. Run the generated executable from the terminal.

## Status
Complete
